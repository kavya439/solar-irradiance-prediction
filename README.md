*SOLAR IRRADIANCE PREDICTION USING METEOROLOGICAL DATA AND AI MODELS*

Think of Solar Irradiance Prediction as a "Sunlight Forecast." Just like a weather app tells you if it will rain, this tool tells you how "strong" the sunlight will be at a specific time and place.

Why do we need it?
For Solar Panels: Solar panels need sunlight to make electricity. If we know exactly how much sun is coming, we know how much power we will have.

For Saving Money: If the app says the sun will be very strong at 2:00 PM, you can run your washing machine or AC then. This uses free solar energy instead of expensive grid electricity.

For the Power Grid: It helps engineers manage the city's electricity so there are no power cuts when clouds block the sun.

How does it work? (The simple logic)
The tool looks at three main things:

The Clock: The sun is strongest at noon and weakest at sunrise/sunset.

The Weather: Clouds, humidity (moisture in the air), and dust can "block" the sun’s rays.

The Location: Some cities (like Tirupati or Chennai) get more direct sunlight than others depending on where they are on Earth.

In Short:
It turns Weather Data into Energy Data. It tells you: "Tomorrow at 12:00 PM, the sun will be at 90% strength, so your solar panels will be full of power!"
